# tabletop
A game chooser system

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/claydiffrient/tabletop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/claydiffrient/tabletop)

Thanks for stopping by :smile: !  This is a system where when connected with the proper api can help you
select a game to play.  It's main purpose is to help Instructure's tabletop group decide what game will be
played in our daily games at lunch.

It's a lightweight node/express backend serving up a React frontend. The api can be found at http://github.com/claydiffrient/tabletop-api
